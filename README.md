## Running Node

NVM (Node Version Manager) settings are stored in .nvmrc. However, unlike Ruby Version Manager, NVM
will not automatically switch to the correct Node version when switching in to the project
directory. When working on this project, unless your default Node version is the same as the one
used here, you will need to run `nvm install`, which will install (if necessary) and switch to the
correct version of Node.
